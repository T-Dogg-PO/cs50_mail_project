# cs50_mail_project
Project 3 for Harvard's CS50 web development course. Focusing on Javascript

Project specifications (along with starting code) can be found ehre - https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/

First attempt at coding Javascript, so please comment on suggestions for improvements to this project if you have them!

I have not yet done a lot of the work with CSS / Bootstrap for styling, but will work on those later down the line. For now everything is functional as per the specification.
